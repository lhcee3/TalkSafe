TalkSafe is an Online Encrypter/Decrypter which has a JavaScript backbone.
All you have to do is enter the text that has to be encrypted and give a passkey.Then using the same passkey decipher the encrypted text using the Decrypt Button.
The passkey here serves as an encryption channel so I suggest using a passkey that can be remembered easily.
Feel free to play around and reach ot me for any bugs
